Octave functions to simulate diffuse magnetic neutron scattering from single-molecule magnets.

The original version of this software was written by Hannah Irons as part of the PhD work under the supervision of Jorge Quintanilla. Further development was carried out by Jorge Quintanilla as aprt of a collaboration with Stuart Gibson and Robert Twyman.

REQUIREMENTS

A working installation of Octave (the software has been tested on Octave 3.4.3; it should be easily adaptable for use with Matlab).

INSTALLATION

No installation required - just place the ".m" file in your working directory.

USAGE

Start Octave.

Type the command

 source "functions_PCA_current.m"

This will make available a number of Octave functions. The usage of each of these functions is documented thorugh comments within the source code.
