# magneto

Octave functions to simulate diffuse magnetic neutron scattering from single-molecule magnets.

The original version of this software was written by Hannah Irons as part of the PhD work under the supervision of Jorge Quintanilla. This was part of a collaboration with Luigi Amico, Toby Perring and Gabriel Aeppli. Further development was carried out by Jorge Quintanilla as part of a subsequent collaboration with Stuart Gibson and Robert Twyman.

REQUIREMENTS

A working installation of Octave (the software has been tested on Octave 3.4.3; the source code has comments explaining how it can be adapted for use on Matlab).

INSTALLATION

Copy the .m files to your working directory.

USAGE

cd to your working directory.

Start Octave.

The new Octave functions will be available (their names are the same as the corresponding filenames, without the ".m").

The usage of each of the functions is documented in comments within its source code.
